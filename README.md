# employee-manager
A simple CMS built on Node and MySQL for the purposes of organizing business departments.

## Description
This is a CLI app that works with a SQL database in order to manage employees, departments and roles.  If you want to create a department and begin adding roles, my software enables you to do that all within the command line (no code required!).  Every prompt is a multiple choice question that enables you to customize your employee manager experience.
